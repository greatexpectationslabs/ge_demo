## Let's get started - a Data Horror Story

Let's assume we have an analytics pipeline tracking NYC taxi data...

## Example: Passenger stats in January

Based on our data, we expect between 1 and 6 passengers per ride

---

## Example: Passenger stats in Feburary

Something happened this month - we didn't expect 0 passengers?

## Could we prevent such issues?

How can we test the monthly update before it gets to the dashboard?

## What does a typical GE workflow look like?
 
1. Create your expectation suites using the knowledge and data you have
    a. These are intended to be version controlled
2. Whenever your data changes (new batch is ingested, pipelines are modified...), validate with the expectation suites
3. Make your pipelines react to validation results, e.g.
    a. Halt the pipeline execution and notify stakeholders
    b. Continue the pipeline execution and log results

## More powerful features!
 
- **Stores**: Allow you to store expectations in different backends, e.g. in S3, databases, etc.
    - Configurable in `great_expectations.yml`
- **Data docs sites**: Allows you to host data docs as a shared source of truth
    - Configurable in `great_expectations.yml`
- **Built-in profiling**: Automatically create expectations based on the data
    - Try out the `suite scaffold` command
    - We're working a lot on profiling this quarter!
